# TACE-prediction
- Download the CNN model from "CNN_model_README.md" into the predictions code found in "prediction.ipynb".
- The given csv data from the Cancer Imaging Archive found in "HCC-TACE-Seg_clinical_data-V2 copy.csv" is used for the Logistic Regression model.
- The code used to build the logistic regression is found in "HCC_TACE_logistic_regression.ipynb"
- The code used to build the Convolutional Neural Network is found in "HCC_TACE_CNN_Model_code.ipynb"
- All images used can be downloaded using the Convolutional Neural Network code (retrieves the images from a zip file in onedrive)
- Download the "HCC-TACE_project-results.pptx" to take a look at results and conclusions for the project
