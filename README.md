# TAPS: a Novel AI system for predicting Transarterial Chemoembolization therapy results on Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients
## Project directions
- This project is a novel Artificial Intelligence system (never made before) which utilizes Machine Learning to predict Transarterial Chemoembolization therapy outcomes for Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients
- Download the CNN model from "CNN_model_README.md" into the predictions code found in "prediction.ipynb".
- The given csv data from the Cancer Imaging Archive found in "HCC-TACE-Seg_clinical_data-V2 copy.csv" is used for the Logistic Regression model.
- The code used to build the logistic regression is found in "HCC_TACE_logistic_regression.ipynb"
- The code used to build the Convolutional Neural Network is found in "HCC_TACE_CNN_Model_code.ipynb"
- All images used can be downloaded using the Convolutional Neural Network code (retrieves the images from a zip file in onedrive)
- Download the "HCC-TACE_project-results.pptx" to take a look at results and conclusions for the project

## Convolutional Neural Network Purpose
The Convolutional Neural Network model is created to provide a predictions system to help professionals when prescribing Transarterial Chemoembolization therapy to their Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients.

## Logistic Regression Purpose
The Logistic Regression model is created to provide insight on what factors are correlated with Transarterial Chemoembolization therapy outcomes.

## Project Impact
Across the world, it is estimated that approximately 700,000 people die of liver cancer every year. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 90% of all liver cancers, primarily diagnosed in its late stages, and has a 5-year survival rate of only 10%. With Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as the most common way to treat HCC, it fails to treat a staggering 60% of patients. Artificial Intelligence is transforming our modern world with numerous applications which allow it to automize processes and provide valuable, accurate, and efficient insights, often saving lives when used in conjunction with Medicine. Inspired by the power of AI in this field, I wanted to address the problem of TACE therapy failures by designing a Novel AI system that can assist medical professionals globally in prescribing the right treatment plan for their HCC patients. However, AI isnâ€™t flawless. Artificial Intelligence has been known to contain biases: ranging from racial bias to the overfitting of data, producing inequalities and erroneous results. These biases can often be limited by using code specifically for this purpose when building the AI model. In my program, I made sure to address this issue by using Checkpoint code which prevented the overfitting of my model to the training data. My solution empowers the community of Oncologists and related medical professionals around the world by providing a free, efficient, accurate, and novel way to predict TACE therapy results, with the potential to save the lives of patients regardless of their economic and social status.

## Women in Medical Artificial Intelligence
Dr. Chathuri Daluwatte is a research fellow at the Food and Drug Administration. She is an inspirational woman who has furthered the field of Medicinal AI by using predictive analysis, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis to improve health devices like physiological monitors. Her passion to better our health systems motivated me to pursue this particular project. As a South Asian woman in STEM, she is a role model to many women, including myself, to pursue our dreams and build a career in STEM.
